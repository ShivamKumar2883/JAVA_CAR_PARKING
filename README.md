# JAVA_CAR_PARKING
--------------------------------
Implement a car-parking system that records which cars are currently parked in the car park. 
 * Only registered cars must be allowed to enter the car park, 
 * so the system must be able to keep a list of authorized vehicles
 * as well as those actually parked at a particular time. 
 * The system must be able to provide a series of reports, 
 * for example indicating whether or not the car park is full, 
 * displaying lists of registered vehicles and those parked.
